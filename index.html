      <p>Hi there, folks! I'm Theo, a young professional from North Carolina. Initially, I studied Communications and
        Theatre at the University of North Carolina, where I graduated Spring 2016. I have a passion for creating new
        things, and in Summer 2018 in Chicago found a spark of inspiration while teaching myself a little bit of html.
        I was completely hooked seeing my first 'Hello World' rendered on a blank white background -- I made a thing!
        It worked! That fall, I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development bootcamp at Northwestern University, and it
        completely changed my life. </p>

      <p>Coding has been a source of pride and personal growth. As somebody who is typically comfortable in performace
        and the arts, it always seemed like an endeavor I could never take on. Doing so while working full time was a
        lot of lost sleep and staring at console logs. But! Nothing quite beats the rush you get when you've refreshed
        your app for the millionth time and instead of seeing that same error message, you've finally sorted another
        piece of the puzzle. I'm daunted and inspired by how much learning there is always left to do. My professional
        journey has just begun, and I'm excited to see where each new challenge leads!</p>
